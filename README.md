<p>In a world of endless holydays, Christmas was celebrated by everyone around the world in the last months of the year. However, its ambition to expand its influence led it to overshadow the other holidays, starting with Halloween. After a surprise attack, Christmas had completely eclipsed Halloween, preventing the holiday from being celebrated as it deserved.

For this reason, Espyro decided to challenge this order. With determination and courage, he embarked on a mission to reclaim the time that rightfully belonged to his holiday and restore balance between the festivities.</p>
