<p>Set in rural Colombia during the 19XXs, the game immerses us in the adventures of Baudilio, an intrepid bounty hunter seeking fame and fortune. Hired across the country to confront the mythical creatures terrorizing the region, Baudilio embarks on a journey filled with dangers and mysteries. However, as he progresses in his mission, he will uncover a far more sinister truth: the real enemy poses a threat not only to the mythical beings but also to Mother Nature herself.</p>

<p>In a world of endless holydays, Christmas was celebrated by everyone around the world in the last months of the year. However, its ambition to expand its influence led it to overshadow the other holidays, starting with Halloween. After a surprise attack, Christmas had completely eclipsed Halloween, preventing the holiday from being celebrated as it deserved.

For this reason, Espyro decided to challenge this order. With determination and courage, he embarked on a mission to reclaim the time that rightfully belonged to his holiday and restore balance between the festivities.</p>
